  listText: "<b>Sofia, my dear, hello!</b> <br> Congratulations on your daughter\u2019s
    long-awaited arrival! I hope you have a wonderful time together.  I need to ask
    you for a favor. Could you stop by the pharmacy and buy some sedatives for my
    husband? Lately, he\u2019s been acting like a complete paranoid. One of his friends
    at the front told him that our city would be bombed, and you should see him now\u2026
    He boarded up all the windows, started buying random apartments, and\u2014worst
    of all\u2014my things have started disappearing! Including my letter and the
    second key to your house.  Please, my dear, get the medicine. I\u2019m sending
    you my house key with this letter, and when you come over, I\u2019ll give you
    yours back.</br>  <b>See you soon! Yours, Lana</b>"

    on the south, is everything\u2019s fine? Did hear about the bombings yesterday?
    Grandparents were left homeless because of them, and there some worries that
    our town is going to be bombed soon, but i don\u2019t believe in that, we\u2019ve
    done nothing wrong, why should they bomb us. Anyway, mom and dad are worrying
    about you maybe you should come and visit us. With love, Bon"

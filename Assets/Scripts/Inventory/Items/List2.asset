    are things in the south? Is everything fine? Did you hear about the bombings
    yesterday? Grandparents lost their home because of them, and there are some worries
    that our town might be bombed soon. But I don\u2019t believe that. We\u2019ve
    done nothing wrong\u2014why would they bomb us?  Anyway, Mom and Dad are worried
    about you. Maybe you should come and visit us.  With love, Bon"

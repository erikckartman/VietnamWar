    won't stop. I'm so scared. I can't find Mama and Papa. I looked everywhere in
    the house, but they are not here. I hope they are safe. I can't stop crying.
    My heart hurts so much. I miss them. Why is this happening? I just want everything
    to be like before, when we were all together and happy. Please, let them come
    back to me\u2026"
